## Introduction

Lean is a powerful functional programming language designed for theorem proving and formal verification. This project aims to provide beginners with the necessary resources and examples to start learning Lean.

## Installation

Iâ€™ll provide how to install it on Mac. 

1. Open VS code, make a virtual environment, and add Lean4 as an extension there.
2. Open the terminal of that VS code and paste:

```jsx
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)" && source ~/.profile
```

this will automatically install Lean on your device.

3. Test it by running `lean` command on the terminal.

## Usage

Provide examples, tutorials, or sample code demonstrating how to use Lean for various tasks or applications.
